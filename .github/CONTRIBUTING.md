## Submitting a Pull Request

To submit a pull request, make sure to follow these steps and requirements:

- read the relevant topics on the documentation at https://bricks.stefanobartoletti.it
- submit your PR's against the `devel` branch, which is used for active development, **not** against `master`
- open a PR's for a single feature or bugfix, multiple modifications of different nature can be submitted with multiple PR's
- run linting scripts (`yarn lint`) before submitting your PR to properly format your code and check for issues (you need to install dependencies with `yarn install` and `composer install` before running linting scripts)
- if submitting a new feature, discuss it by opening an issue before even start working on it. This is required to make sure that the new feature is something that is really needed or wanted and thus having it green-lighted, and to receive some feedback and suggestions about how to properly implement it.
